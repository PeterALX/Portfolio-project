# Frontend specializations portfolio project
[live site](https://peteralx.vercel.app/)

This is my project for ALX's frontend specialization's final project.
It is a personal portfolio with a backend that enables content editing. ie. I can add projects and experience as I go without having to touch the code.
## Note to reviewer:
- In the video demo, I didn't show changes in the CMS modifying the frontend.
- This was because I had to rush the video demo to beat the deadline (totally my bad), and there were some issues with revalidation in next js.
- I have since fixed those revalidation issues. Here is a short video showing me editing the content in the CMS and the resulting automatic changes to the CMS.ðŸ‘‡
